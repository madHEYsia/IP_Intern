# Image Processing Intern task

A rock plug called as core plug is generally a cylindrical shaped rock sample extracted from the Earth’s subsurface while drilling (generally for oil/gas). This volume of rock is made up of grains or minerals, comprising of both solid matrix and pores, i.e. voids. The CT scanning of this core plug is performed and from each plug, hundreds of 2D slices are obtained.

In this problem, there are three CT scanned slices, namely ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ of different resolutions (refer images in this repository). The details are:
⦁	38mm in diameter with pixel size of 22μm
⦁	9.5mm in diameter with pixel size of 5.5μm
⦁	2.5mm side with pixel size of 2μm

So, for each of this scanned image, 
⦁	Segregate the pores & grains and determine the Porosity.
⦁	Classify the pore sizes into: Micro pore (<20μm), Meso pore (20-100μm) and Macro pore (>100μm) and determine their respective fractions.
